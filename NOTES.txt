this is pretty basic to run:

1) cd into the client directory
2) in terminal type: `npm run dev`

*Note if this does not work run `npm install`
and then run `npm run dev`*

3) CTRL-click the localhost/port link to open in browser

For the form I used some basic bootstrap 
to make styling the elements easier.
bootstrap should already be downloaded 
to the node_modules directory but if you run into any errors,
cd into client and type `npm install bootstrap`
